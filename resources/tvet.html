        <h1>Technical and Vocational Trainings in Mahama Refugee Camp</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In 2015, Burundian refugees faced significant challenges in Mahama Refugee Camp, including limited access to education
            and vocational training opportunities. Many students had to discontinue their studies in technical and vocational
            fields. Recognizing the importance of addressing this issue, ADRA and other organizations such as GIZ, Red Cross,
            Caritas, and Maison Shalom stepped in to provide short courses and trainings to the refugees.
       </p>
          <h2>policies of Rwanda in TVET</h2>
        <p>
            Education policies in Rwanda emphasise the right of all children, including refugees, to receive an education and combat
            ignorance. Thus, refugees were enrolled in Technical Vocational Training (TVT) schools to equip them with valuable
            skills for self-reliance and financial independence.

        </p>
           <h2>Pertnership with NGOs</h2>
        <p>
            Red Cross Rwanda, in collaboration with Red Cross Belgium, played a significant role in supporting the youth in Mahama
            Refugee Camp. The beneficiaries were provided with technical and vocational education training, with approximately Rwf
            160 million invested in the program. The training took place in two boarding schools in the Eastern Province: Amizero
            Institute of Technology and Hospitality TVET School (AMITH) and Institute of Polytechnic Regional Centre (IPRC) Ngoma
            Campus. The training programs focused on hairdressing and plumbing and lasted for three months, including one month of
            practical training.

        <p>
            Alight, in partnership with Maison Shalom, has been actively supporting refugees in Rwanda. Maison Shalom provides
            comprehensive assistance to refugees, including educational, psychosocial, economic, and socio-cultural support, with
            the goal of enabling refugees to live in exile with dignity and preparing them for a future return to their home
            country.
