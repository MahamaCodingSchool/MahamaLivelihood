        <h1>HEALTH CARE AND NUTRITION IN MAHAMA REFUGEE CAMP</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>When Mahama Camp opened in April 2015,AMercan Refugee Committee were the first partners to provide a range 
          of primary health services. These services included In-Patient care, Outpatient care, and 
          Maternity services. Over time, the camp expanded, and additional services like HIV programs, 
          Maternal Child Health, Antenatal Care, Vaccination, Mental health support, and Nutrition 
          management for acute malnutrition were introduced to meet the growing needs of the camp population.

        <p>
          Save the Children joined the efforts in August 2015 and established a second healthcare facility 
          in Mahama II to deliver essential primary healthcare services. In December 2015, the health post 
          was transformed into a health center by Save the Children, expanding its capacity to meet the 
          healthcare needs of over 25,000 refugees residing in that area of the camp. UNFPA has also 
          contributed by providing much-needed equipment to enhance health services.
        </p>
        <h2>Innovation of Infratructures and services</h2>
        <p>
          Recently, Save the Children newly expanded its sevices by introducing Emergency Cesarean Services. The center offers comprehensive 
          obstetrical and newborn care services, including cesarean sections, blood transfusions, maternal child 
          health services, outpatient and inpatient consultations, laboratory services, and nutrition outreach. <br>

          The cesarean operations were conducted to address obstetric complications, and we are pleased to report 
          that all mothers and their babies are in good health.
        </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the renovated laboratories at Mahama refugee camp play a vital role in meeting the 
            government's requirements for screening and vaccinating Burundian immigrants against Yellow Fever. 
            They also support the Ministry of Health's immunization program by ensuring proper storage and 
            administration of vaccines. <br><br>

            Both health centers, namely Mahama 1 Health Center and Mahama 2 Health Center, serve the two sections 
            of the camp. These centers have undergone renovations, including the refurbishment of medical isolation 
            facilities and laboratories, tiling, painting, window replacement, and procurement of new laboratory 
            furniture and equipment.
          </p>
          <h2>First aid</h2>
          <p>
            The ICRC is fully dedicated to delivering healthcare programs that are of the highest quality and 
            accountability, adhering to professional standards. We frequently collaborate with other organizations, 
            bringing together experts from various fields, and one such collaboration is the Health Care in Danger 
            project. This initiative aims to safeguard access to healthcare by preventing attacks or hindrances.

          <h2>NUTRITION</h2>
          <p>
            According to WFP, Nutrition services include routine screening and management of malnutrition through
            supplementary feeding programs for children under five years, pregnant and lactating mothers,
            and those living with HIV, are delivered by UNHCR and health partners. <br><br>
            In the Mahama refugee camp, 120 community health volunteers conduct community outreach
            programs to promote positive health behaviors, promote healthy nutrition and assist case
            referrals to health facilities. Community health volunteers are also trained to treat common
            childhood illnesses in the community. <br><br>
            
            There are other organizations including RED CROSS-Rwanda, PLAN INTERNATIONAL, and NUTRITIONAL EDUCATION 
            COUNCIL(NEC) project
            all of these organizations tried their best to  cope with and address malnutrition for the sake of 
            Burundian and other refugees settling in the Mahama Refugee camp

            Red Cross Rwanda  addresses this issue of malnutrition by cultivating  diverse green vegetables and  
            beetroots for the beneficiaries and at the health care center
