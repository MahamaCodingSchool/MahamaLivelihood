            <p>Before getting started, the students were trained about eradication of Gender
                Based Violance and Computer fundamentals:
                <ol type="I">
                    <li><h3>Gender-based Violance (<abbr>GBV</abbr>)</h3></li>
                    <p>According to <strong>UNHCR</strong>, <em>Gender-Based Violence</em> is a 
                        serious violation of human rights and a life-threatening health and protection 
                        issue. When people flee their homes, they are often at greater risk of physical, 
                        sexual and psychological violence, such as rape, sexual abuse, trafficking and 
                        forced prostitution. <br><br>
                        
                        Although anyone: women, girls, men and boys;  can fall victim to violence 
                        simply because of their sex or gender, women and girls are especially at risk. 
                        It is estimated that one in three women will experience sexual or physical 
                        violence in their lifetime. <br><br>
                        
                        Gender-based violence is preventable and UNHCR is committed to promoting gender 
                        equality and protecting displaced and stateless people from GBV.
                    </p>
                    <li><h3>Computer fundamentals</h3></li>
                    <p>A computer is an advanced electronic device that takes raw data as an input from the 
                        user and processes it under the control of a set of instructions (called program), 
                        produces a result (output), and saves it for future use. <br><br>
                        
                        This course explains the foundational concepts of computer hardware, software, operating systems, 
                        peripherals, etc. along with how to get the most value and impact from computer 
                        technology.</p>
