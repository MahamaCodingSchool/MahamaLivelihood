    <h3>Gender-based Violance (<abbr>GBV</abbr>)</h3>
    <p>According to <strong>UNHCR</strong>, <em>Gender-Based Violence</em> is a 
      serious violation of human rights and a life-threatening health and protection 
      issue. When people flee their homes, they are often at greater risk of physical, 
      sexual and psychological violence, such as rape, sexual abuse, trafficking and 
      forced prostitution. <br><br>
      Although anyone: women, girls, men and boys;  can fall victim to violence 
      simply because of their sex or gender, women and girls are especially at risk. 
      It is estimated that one in three women will experience sexual or physical 
      violence in their lifetime. <br><br>
      Gender-based violence is preventable and UNHCR is committed to promoting gender 
      equality and protecting displaced and stateless people from GBV.
