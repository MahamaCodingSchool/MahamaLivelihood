        <h1>GENERAL EDUCATION IN MAHAMA CAMP</h1>
        <h2>Education Background</h2>
        <p>Education refers to the discipline that is concerned with methods of teaching and learning in schools or school-like environments, as opposed to various non formal and informal means of socialization.
        </p>

            Mahama refugee camp is home to Rwanda's largest school, Paysannat L, which serves over 20,000 children from both the
            refugee camp and the Rwandan host community. To effectively manage the large student population, the school was divided
            into five campuses in 2019. These campuses are spread across the host community surrounding the camp and within Mahama
            camp itself. <br> <br>
            Given the significant number of students, the primary level of the school operates on a double shift system. This means
            that some students attend classes in the morning while others attend in the afternoon. In total, there are 11,964
            refugee children enrolled in primary education, with 6,031 boys and 5,933 girls. Additionally, there are 4,593 students
            attending secondary education, consisting of 2,457 boys and 2,136 girls.

        </p>
        <h2>Pre primary & Primary Education</h2>
        <div class="image">

        <p>
            According to a report by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the primary school enrollment rate stands at 68
            percent. To accommodate a large number of students, a double shift system is implemented at the primary level, with some
            students attending classes in the morning and others in the afternoon. Currently, a total of 11,964 refugee children
            (6,031 boys and 5,933 girls) are enrolled in primary school. <br><br>

        <p>
            In order to enhance education, UNHCR supports connected learning through the Profuturo platform for upper primary
            students in levels four to six. Furthermore, efforts are being made to improve teachers' ICT teaching skills. <br><br>

            Unfortunately, the Early Childhood Development (ECD) center, which comprises ten classrooms, is not operational due to a
            lack of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) facilities. To address this issue, UNHCR has completed the construction of
            eight classrooms and initiated the construction of an additional 28 classrooms. However, limited budgetary resources
            pose challenges in constructing latrines and providing technical equipment in the classrooms.
        </p>
        <h2>Secondary & tertiary education</h2>
        <p>
            According to a report by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the enrollment rates for secondary education and
            tertiary education stand at only 34 percent and 5 percent, respectively. Mahama refugee camp is home to the largest school in Rwanda, Paysannat L, which provides education for over 20,000
            children from both the refugee camp and the Rwandan host community. To effectively manage a large number of students,
            the school was divided into five campuses in 2019, situated within the host community surrounding the camp and within
            Mahama camp itself. Among these students, 4,593 (2,457 boys and 2,136 girls) attend secondary education. In collaboration with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and other partners, UNICEF has contributed to the construction of
            additional classrooms at Paysannat L school in the Rwandan host community. Additionally, UNICEF is working in
            conjunction with the Ministry in Charge of Emergency Management and Refugee Affairs and the Ministry of Education to
            integrate all refugee students into the national school system. <br><br>

            Refugees and asylum-seekers in Rwanda have access to inclusive education at all levels. The Rwandan government allows
            refugee children and youth to attend public primary, secondary, and tertiary education on equal terms with nationals.
            UNHCR, in collaboration with partners, works to promote the inclusion of refugees and asylum-seekers in the national
            education system, where they can attend school alongside host community children. The Ministry of Education (MINEDUC),
            Rwanda Education Board (REB), and Ministry in Charge of Emergency Management (MINEMA) closely cooperate with UNHCR and
            other education stakeholders to ensure the full integration of refugees at all levels of the national education system. <br><br>

            Refugee youth have opportunities to access tertiary education through various scholarship programs at university and
            Technical, Vocational Education and Training (TVET) levels. The DAFI (Albert Einstein German Academic Refugee
            Initiative) scholarship program, primarily supported by the Government of Germany and private-sector partners and
            foundations, is managed by UNHCR in partnership with the government and an NGO. Currently, the Adventist Development and
            Relief Agency (ADRA) in Rwanda is facilitating the implementation of the DAFI program. Other scholarship opportunities
            are provided by Maison Shalom, Kepler, Impact Hope, African Leadership University (ALU), and GIZ, covering secondary
            schools, TVET, and university-level studies. <br><br>

            In conclusion, education offers numerous advantages in the Mahama camp. It helps prevent youth from becoming idle,
            engaging in substance abuse, and early pregnancies.
