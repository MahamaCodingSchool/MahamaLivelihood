        <h1>SOCIAL COHESION</h1>
        <p>Social cohesion refers to the strength of connections and the sense of solidarity among individuals within a community.
        From 2015 onwards, refugees faced significant challenges as they were unable to engage in various activities such as
        business due to the lack of necessary documents, including refugee ID proof registration. However, the UNHCR in Rwanda
        gradually addressed this issue.

        <h2>Identifification Document(ID) Provision</h2>
        <p>
            Initially, the Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs (Midimar) distributed approximately 2,760 cards
            primarily to Burundian and some Congolese refugees. Subsequently, verification exercises were conducted by the
            government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to collect biometric data.
</p>
        <p>
        All refugees aged 16 and above now have access to a Refugee Identity Card issued by the National Identification Agency
        (NIDA). Additionally, refugees possess a document called "Proof of Registration," jointly issued by the Government of
        Rwanda (MINEMA) and UNHCR, which serves as a proxy ID (in A4 paper format). While the requirements include Proof of
        Registration, having a birth certificate or passport is not mandatory.
</p>
        <h2>Diversity in the Mmahama refugee camp</h2>
        <p>
        Within the Mahama Refugee Camp, which accommodates refugees from various countries such as Burundi, Congo, South Sudan,
        and Eritrea, social relations among refugees are characterized by a sense of harmony and shared experiences. Despite
        their diverse backgrounds, they engage in activities that foster unity, such as public works, religious practices, and
        business ventures. The camp inhabitants live in peaceful coexistence, frequently coming together for various development
        initiatives that contribute to their harmonious existence.
 </p>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>
        Furthermore, there is interaction between the refugee population and the host community. Rwandans and refugees study
        together, while some refugees pray outside the camp and some members of the host community participate in activities
        within the camp. They engage in shared endeavors such as business, public works, and religious practices, fostering a
        sense of connection.
