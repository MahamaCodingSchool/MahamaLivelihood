        <h1>HUMANITARIAN SERVICES IN MAHAMA REFUGEE CAMP</h1>
        <h2>IMPROVING THE LIVES OF CHILDREN</h2>
        <p>
            Initially (2015), the lives of children in the camp were challenging rather than today. However, in 2015 and 2016, Plan International Rwanda
            provided support, followed by Save The Children's assistance in 2017, which placed them in foster families. Since then,
            significant improvements have been observed. The children's health has improved, they attend school, receive medical
            care, and are provided with clothing, shoes, and their rights as children are respected. Without this ongoing support,
            they would be deprived of education and face a bleak future.
</p>
        <h2>ASSISTANCE FOR THE ELDERLY</h2>
        <p>
            From 2015 up to today 2023 The elderly population is not neglected in the camp. They have received valuable aid, including flour for sustenance,
            literacy, and art classes, thanks to the support of Cartas Rwanda. This assistance empowers them to lead better lives,
            as they gain knowledge and skills. Without such support, their quality of life today would be compromised, making it
            challenging for them to engage in physically demanding tasks.

        </p>
        <h2>SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</h2>
        <p>
        Today in 2023 People with disabilities receive special attention in the camp. They are provided with essential items such as flour,
        walking aids, medical treatment for their specific needs, wheelchairs, clothing, and hygiene materials. Additionally,
        they engage in various recreational activities facilitated by HANDICAP INTERNATIONAL. This comprehensive support aims to
        enhance their well-being and foster inclusivity within the community.

        </p>
        <h2>CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES</h2>
        <p>
        During a visit to Mahama II Health Centre, Kirehe District officials assessed the progress made in response to
        recommendations from the Ministry of Health and Save The Children. The health center was upgraded by Save The Children
        to provide emergency obstetric services, including cesarean sections and blood transfusions. Starting from November 1,
        2022, the Medicalized Health Centre is expected to offer surgical services. Save The Children also plays a crucial role
        in providing from innauguration of that C-sectioning.
